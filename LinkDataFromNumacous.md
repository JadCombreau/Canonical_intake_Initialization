## Link Data From Numacous
### Script Language

All the __Link Data From Numacous__ box is written in Shell UNIX language.
### What the box does ?

This script allows the copy of the data present from the Numacous directory to our Job folder.
For this, the scripts will process all the following files, created previously :

- ACOUSMESH
- INTERPOLMESH
- MICROPHONES
- INPUTS
- INFO
- FLOW
- FLOWMESH
- SCOUT

The input XML file previously nammed "input.xml" will be copied and renamed "previous.xml" in our Job folder.

*__Link Data from Numacous__ box is preceded by the __Get Mesh & Models Frequencies__ box, which consist in the creation of the model frequency list, linked to the linear frequency and followed by the __Build Paths__ box which consist in the creation of different file paths necessary for all the Workflow.*
