## Scenario Analyser
### Script Language

All the __Scenario Analyser__ box is written in Python language.
### What the box does ?

The __Scenario Analyzer__ script allows you to test if there are missing folders/files after the first execution of the workflow (during the first execution, all repositories exists but are empty ...). This script therefore avoids restarting all configurations/frequencies and therefore saves a lot of time.

This script must therefore be able to check if a file is missing in a specific folder (we know exactly the number of configurations and frequencies to launch).

To begin, this script must copy the Numacous Repository and remove folder if it already exists.

__This script must therefore test the existence of each member of the following list :__

- isFlowMesh
- isFlow
- areAcousticMeshConstraints
- areAllAcousticMeshes
- isAcousGeomData
- areMicrophones
- areAllInterpolatedMeshes
- areAllCutoffResults
- areAllScoutResultsAndMemos
- areAllComputationsResults

*__Scenario Analyser__ box is preceded by the __Build Paths__ box which consist in the creation of different file paths necessary for all the Workflow. This box is followed by the __Copy Init__ Workflow subpart which consists in copying folders from our Job folder (after modifications) into the Numacous folder.*

### Which files to import ?

To execute the script __Scenario Analyser__ correctly, we need to import Python libraries.
The table below lists all the imports to be made :

| Import name | Import location |
| ------ | ------ |
| Logger | `/python/workflows/common` |
| ScenarioAnalyser | `/python/workflows/ductnoise/fannoise/ananax/ananax2d_canonical_intake` |

### What about variables ?

The table below lists all the variables to be created in Isight and their role :

__Mapped inputs variables to receive to previous boxes :__
